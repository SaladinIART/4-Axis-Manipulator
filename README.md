# 4-Axis-Manipulator
4 axis manipulator using sheet metals and DIY materials. Currently just finish CAD. Future plan going to be ROS2 implementation.

Ok basically this project already on hold for about year due to my insurficient knowledge of programming,(C++, Python and Linux Architecture). Thus, currently I just uploaded my current CAD design. Feel free to modify and im open for suggestion.

As for the CAD files, i will upload through GrabCad/or any recommended server in future. The project currently on hold due to lack of hardware, testing equipments and fund. Hopefully in near future will be able to continue the project.
